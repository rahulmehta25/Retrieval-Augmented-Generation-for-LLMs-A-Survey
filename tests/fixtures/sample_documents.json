      "content": "Neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as 'cat' or 'no cat'.",
