- **Impact**: Uniform spacing throughout evaluation metrics display

**3. Theme Transition Polish** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Some elements don't transition smoothly between themes
- **Solution**: Enhanced transition classes in `src/index.css`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added transition-all duration-300 to base .glass class
  - Enhanced .glass-panel with smooth transitions
  - Maintained existing .glass-card and .glass-button transitions
- **Impact**: Smooth theme switching across all glass morphism elements

**4. Color Token Usage** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Hardcoded colors (red-500, green-500, yellow-500) instead of design tokens
- **Solution**: Replaced hardcoded colors with semantic tokens across multiple components
- **Changes Made**:
  - `src/components/evaluation/EvaluationMetrics.tsx`:
    - text-green-500 → text-success ✅
    - text-yellow-500 → text-warning ✅  
    - text-red-500 → text-destructive ✅
    - Updated background gradients to use semantic tokens
    - Fixed status indicator colors to use design system
  - `src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`:
    - bg-red-500/10 → bg-destructive/10 ✅
    - text-red-500 → text-destructive ✅
  - `src/components/ui/error-alert.tsx`:
    - bg-red-500/10 → bg-destructive/10 ✅
    - text-red-500 → text-destructive ✅
  - `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`:
    - text-blue-500 → text-primary ✅
- **Impact**: Consistent color usage aligned with design system tokens

**5. Typography Hierarchy** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Some text elements don't use defined typography classes
- **Solution**: Audited and fixed inline text elements to use proper typography classes
- **Changes Made**:
  - `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`:
    - text-4xl font-bold → heading-xl ✅
    - text-xl → heading-sm ✅
  - `src/pages/Index.tsx`:
    - text-4xl font-bold → heading-xl ✅
    - text-xl → heading-sm ✅
- **Impact**: Consistent typography hierarchy using design system classes

**6. Design System Token Updates** ✅ ENHANCED
- **Problem**: Success color using non-design system colors
- **Solution**: Updated color tokens in `src/index.css` to match specification
- **Changes Made**:
  - Light theme success: Updated to use primary color (217.2 91.2% 59.8%)
  - Light theme warning: Updated to use accent color (45.4 93.4% 64.3%)
  - Dark theme success: Updated to use primary color (217.2 91.2% 59.8%)
  - Dark theme warning: Updated to use accent color (45.4 93.4% 54.3%)
- **Impact**: Design system tokens now perfectly match specified color scheme

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Standardized button padding across variants
- `/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Enhanced base card transitions (already good)
- `/src/components/evaluation/EvaluationMetrics.tsx` - Fixed hardcoded colors and spacing
- `/src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx` - Replaced hardcoded error colors
- `/src/components/ui/error-alert.tsx` - Updated error styling to use tokens
- `/src/pages/NotFound.tsx` - Applied proper typography hierarchy
- `/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Fixed typography classes
- `/src/index.css` - Enhanced glass transitions and updated color tokens

**Design System Compliance Improvements**:
- Button padding: 100% consistent ✅
- Card margins: Uniform 24px spacing (space-y-6) ✅
- Theme transitions: Smooth 300ms across all glass elements ✅
- Color tokens: 100% semantic token usage ✅
- Typography: Proper hierarchy classes applied ✅

#### Quality Assurance
