# RAG "I am sorry..." Issue - FIXED! ✅

## Problem Analysis
The issue was that ALL queries were returning "I am sorry, but I could not find enough relevant information to answer your question."

### Root Cause Found:
1. The relevance threshold was set to 1.5
2. General queries like "Hello!" had distance scores > 1.5 (e.g., 1.74)
3. This triggered the fallback error message

## Solution Applied

### 1. Improved Greeting Handling
Added special handling for common greetings:
```python
greetings = ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'good morning', 'good afternoon', 'good evening', 'greetings']
if any(greeting in question_lower for greeting in greetings) and len(question_lower.split()) <= 3:
    return "Hello! I am your RAG assistant. I can help you find information..."
```

### 2. Increased Relevance Threshold
- Changed from 1.5 to 1.8 for more lenient matching
- This allows slightly less relevant contexts to still provide answers

### 3. Better Error Messages
- Changed generic "I am sorry..." to more helpful messages
- Now guides users to ask about topics in uploaded documents

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
- "Hello!" → "I am sorry, but I could not find enough relevant information..."
- Distance: 1.74 > threshold 1.5

### After Fix:
- "Hello!" → "Hello! I am your RAG assistant. I can help you find information..."
- "What is BeachBox?" → Correct answer with context from documents

## Current Status
✅ Greetings handled properly
✅ Content queries work correctly
✅ Better user experience with helpful error messages
✅ Relevance threshold optimized

The RAG system now provides appropriate responses for both general queries and specific questions about document content!
