## 🎯 Enhanced Features to Test

### 1. **Advanced Document Support** 📄
**Location**: Documents Tab

#### Test Different Formats:
- [ ] **PDF Files**: Upload a PDF document
  - Verify text extraction works
  - Check if multiple pages are processed
  - Confirm content appears in queries

- [ ] **Word Documents (DOCX)**: Upload a .docx file
  - Test formatted text preservation
  - Verify paragraph structure maintained

- [ ] **Excel Files (XLS/XLSX)**: Upload spreadsheet
  - Check if all sheets are processed
  - Verify data is searchable

- [ ] **Text/Markdown**: Upload .txt or .md files
  - Should work as before
  - Fast processing

**Expected Results**: All formats should upload successfully and be queryable

### 2. **Graph RAG with Real Documents** 🕸️
**Location**: RAG Testing Tab → Select "graph"

#### Testing Steps:
1. **First Run** (builds graph):
   ```
   - Upload at least 2-3 documents
   - Select "graph" RAG type
   - Enter: "What are the main topics in the documents?"
   - Wait for "Building knowledge graph..." message
   ```

2. **Subsequent Queries** (uses built graph):
   ```
   - Ask: "What entities are mentioned?"
   - Ask: "How are concepts related?"
   - Ask: "What connections exist between topics?"
   ```

**Expected**: Graph RAG should identify entities and relationships from your documents

### 3. **Real Streaming (SSE)** ⚡
**Location**: Streaming Tab

#### Test Real-Time Streaming:
1. Enter a question: "Explain machine learning in detail"
2. Click "🌊 Test Streaming"
3. **Watch for**:
   - "🔍 Retrieval complete" message
   - Tokens appearing word-by-word
   - "✅ Streaming complete!" at the end

**Expected**: You should see the answer appear progressively, not all at once

### 4. **Production RAG Features** 🏭
**Location**: RAG Testing Tab

#### Test Each RAG Type with Same Query:
Query to use: **"What is the relationship between AI and machine learning?"**

1. **Naive RAG**
   - Basic retrieval and generation
   - Fastest response time
   - Baseline quality

2. **Advanced RAG**
   - Query optimization
   - Should show improved relevance
   - Slightly slower

3. **Modular RAG**
   - Component-based processing
   - Configurable pipeline
   - Good for testing different setups

4. **Graph RAG**
   - Entity-relationship based
   - Best for connected information
   - Shows knowledge structure

5. **Self RAG**
   - Self-reflection and critique
   - Highest quality answers
   - Slowest but most accurate

6. **Auto**
   - Automatic routing
   - Should pick best strategy
   - Adaptive to query type

### 5. **RAGAS Evaluation Metrics** 📊
**Location**: RAG Testing Tab

1. Enable "Enable RAGAS Evaluation" toggle
2. Submit any query
3. **Check metrics**:
   - **Faithfulness**: Is answer grounded in contexts?
   - **Answer Relevancy**: Does it answer the question?
   - **Context Relevancy**: Are retrieved docs relevant?
   - **Context Precision**: Is ranking optimal?

**Good scores**: > 0.7 (green)
**Acceptable**: 0.4-0.7 (yellow)
**Needs improvement**: < 0.4 (red)

### 6. **Analytics Dashboard** 📈
**Location**: Analytics Tab

After running 5-10 queries:
- **Pie Chart**: Distribution of RAG types used
- **Box Plot**: Processing time comparison
- **Timeline**: Query performance over time
- **Bar Chart**: Average RAGAS scores

### 7. **Advanced Document Processing Test** 🔬

Create a test document with diverse content:

```python
# Save as test_advanced.txt
"""

## 🧪 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics:

| RAG Type | Response Time | Quality | Best For |
|----------|--------------|---------|----------|
| Naive | 1-2s | Basic | Simple queries |
| Advanced | 2-3s | Good | Complex questions |
| Graph | 2-4s | Excellent | Entity relationships |
| Self | 3-5s | Best | Critical accuracy |
| Streaming | Real-time | Good | User experience |

### Cache Performance:
- First query: 2-3s
- Repeated query: <100ms (cache hit)
- Cache hit rate target: >30%

## 🔥 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Multi-Document Reasoning**
Upload related documents (e.g., multiple chapters of a book) and ask:
- "Summarize the main themes across all documents"
- "What contradictions exist between documents?"
- "Trace the evolution of ideas"

### 2. **Complex Query Decomposition**
Test with compound questions:
- "What is AI, how does it differ from ML, and what are practical applications?"
- "Compare and contrast supervised vs unsupervised learning with examples"

### 3. **Conversation Memory**
In RAG Testing, ask follow-up questions:
1. "What is deep learning?"
2. "How does it work?" (should understand 'it' refers to deep learning)
3. "Give me an example" (should provide deep learning example)

### 4. **Error Recovery**
Test edge cases:
- Empty query → Should handle gracefully
- 1000+ character query → Should process or limit
- Special characters (@#$%^&*) → Should sanitize
- No documents → Should inform user

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If streaming doesn't work:
1. Check if API endpoint exists: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/chat/stream?question=test`
2. Verify SSE headers in response
3. Check browser console for errors

### If Graph RAG fails:
1. Ensure documents are uploaded first
2. Check if spaCy model is installed: `python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
3. Verify entity extraction works

### If document upload fails:
1. Check file size (<10MB recommended)
2. Verify file format is supported
3. Check API logs for errors

### If RAGAS evaluation is slow:
1. It makes multiple LLM calls
2. Consider disabling for faster responses
3. Use smaller model for evaluation
